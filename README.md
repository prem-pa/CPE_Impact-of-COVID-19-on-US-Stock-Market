# CPE_Impact-of-COVID-19-on-US-Stock-Market

The project is designed to predict stocks from various industries based on the potential effects that the Coronavirus (COVID-19), will have on the economy. We would like to
recommend stocks in a way such that an individual could profit off the market amidst the global viral outbreak. It is important to consider past outbreaks and come to a conclusion that the market will react adversely to such situations in the short run however the market does eventually correct itself in the long run.
